This is my first complete project. If you want to run it, please click on this link. https://portfolio2-gugw7rzxyfyk6vm6x39mnh.streamlit.app/

What it does:
  + Gives you a dashboard of your portfolio
  + Shows your asset location by sector and the average returns of these sectors
  + Shows a timeseries of your portfolio against the s&p500
  + Provides basic dividend information and company financial data
  + Displays a correlation matrix of your asset mix
  + Shows a histogram of your daily log returns, your 95% VaR, and its CVaR
  + Displays a timeseries of your portfolio's drawdowns and Sharpe ratio
  + Tells you what would be your optimal weights to maximise returns and minimise volatility in the stocks you are interested in
  + Monte Carlo simulation over 1000 trading days
  + LSTM portfolio return for next month (this is experimental so any results from this should be taken with a grain of salt)
